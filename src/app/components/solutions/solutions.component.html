<div class="solution-block-title">Interview Coaching</div>

<div class="solution-block-text">Interview coaching will include an assessment of the client’s strengths and weaknesses in order to hone their skillset so that they can soar in an interview setting. Interventions will ultimately include a mock interview that will give the client a detailed assessment of their interviewing skills and areas in which they can improve.</div>

<ul class="solution-block-list">
<li>Two one-on-one sessions (1.5 hours each)</li>

<div class="solution-block-text ave-md">Here’s how we’ll spend the sessions together</div>

<div class="solution-block-text">
<span class="ave-blk">First 1.5 Hour Session :</span>
Your assigned coach will start with a diagnostic mock interview. It’ll help us calibrate your current interview performance. From there, we’ll offer an assessment of how you’re currently performing. They’ll explain what’s working, what’s not, and how to improve it. Then, much like a physical therapist, the coach will start working with you on a variety of exercises to develop your personal brand and interview responses, tailored to you. At the end of the first session, the coach will email you notes, summarizing areas of improvement and exercises they’d like you to complete before the next session.
</div>

<div class="solution-block-text">
<span class="ave-blk">Second 1.5 Hour Session :</span>
The coach will review your preparation, including your completed homework exercises. After the review, the coach will do another mock interview with you. You’ll get on-the-spot coaching to help you sound confident, polished, and relaxed.
